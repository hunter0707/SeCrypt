# SeCrypt

very simple file security system built with python using Tkinter and Fernet

Current functions:
- basic GUI built using Tkinter
- locks selected file using Fernet
- allows for random generation of passwords

Possible future implementations:
- locked files when opened will run python script to open tkinter window to prompt unlocking
- 2FA and/or mobile authentication
- salting of passwords
- looks for downloads and asks users if they should be locked

basically everything is hardcoded and isn't great but I did this for fun to learn how to use Tkinter and some basic encryption, so if you want to use this for whatever reasons instead of the other (better) apps out there, your files will not be very secure.
