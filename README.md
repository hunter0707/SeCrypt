# SeCrypt

very simple file security system built with python using Tkinter and Fernet

Current functions:
- basic GUI built using Tkinter
- locks selected file using Fernet
- allows for random generation of passwords
- currently does not function because I tried to make a change but everything is kind of messed up now :(

Future implementations:
- hide hash and pass keys in file using ADS
- locked files when opened with run python script to open tkinter window to prompt unlocking
- 2FA and/or mobile authentication
- salting of passwords
- locks downloaded files containing sensitive information
